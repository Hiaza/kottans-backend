Exercise 1:
That was an online course about git. As for me I was familiar with all of this git commands, so it was not so difficult to finish that tasks. I discovered some new information such as: -what kind of information stored in .git.

Exercise 2:
I got to know some new commands that related to branching:
- git checkout
- git merge
- git rebase 
- git branch -f [branch name] HEAD ~[num] 
- git reset, git revert
- git cherry-pick

interactive mode for rebaseing git rebase -i HEAD~[NUM]
